### Fashion Product Recommendation System using Transfer Learning and Linear Algebra

This project implements a product recommendation system commonly used by e-commerce platforms. It leverages transfer learning techniques along with the basics of linear algebra to provide recommendations based on image similarity.

**Key Components:**

- **Transfer Learning:** Utilizes a pre-trained ResNet50 model to extract features from fashion product images. The model's top layers are removed, and a global max pooling layer is added to obtain feature vectors for each image efficiently.

- **Feature Extraction:** Images are preprocessed and passed through the modified ResNet50 model to obtain feature embeddings. These embeddings are then normalized using L2 normalization.

- **Nearest Neighbor Search:** The normalized feature vectors are stored in memory, and a brute-force nearest neighbor algorithm is used to find similar images based on Euclidean distance.

- **Recommendation Generation:** Given a query image, its feature embedding is computed and used to find the nearest neighbors. The top similar images are then displayed as recommendations.

**Usage:**

- The system takes an input image and returns top visually similar product recommendations.
- Demonstrates the effectiveness of transfer learning in extracting meaningful features from images.
- Provides a practical example of utilizing linear algebra concepts such as vector normalization for similarity computation.

This project showcases the integration of deep learning, computer vision, and linear algebra techniques to build a powerful recommendation system for fashion products.
